      <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2004 I have been passionate about storytelling in all its forms. When I first attended college, City Tech in Brooklyn, I began to hone my abilities. Below is a short piece of creative writing, something of a memoir.<br><br><i>What’s Missing</i> by Raymond Del Rosario<br><br>There wasn’t a single thing missing. The table was modest sized, and although it was not trimmed in gold and marble—it was a banquet for my working-class family. The wooden frame held many meals and even more memories throughout the years. There was turkey, with dark-brown skin acquired from several hours roasting in the oven. Its legs rested on the edges of the aluminum pan, beckoning us into pulling one of those suckas’ right off. My mother’s famous lasagna, even with the glare I could see the crispy, burnt edges—my favorite. My aunt’s handmade, fork pressed empanadas, always a surprise waiting inside, shrimp, cheese, beef, guava? Take a bite to find out.<br><br>There were several bowls of rices; white, yellow, and mixed with pinto beans. There was the legendary homemade bread, a recipe passed down from Papà, my grandfather, the baker. Vegetables were pilled up in their own little neighborhood. And the salads, oh the salads! Shrimp salad (with a sizable amount left to the side for my brother whose palate did not agree with the taste of seafood), potato salad, your traditional green salad, and ensalada de marisco (not to be confused with seafood salad, which lacked Caribbean spices, this pretty much means we throw Adobo and lemon on it and think it tastes better). It was a familiar setup.<br><br>I could almost smell it all.<br><br>They passed my face, imposed on my brother’s tablet, from person to person; aunts, uncles (even uncle Joe, who would normally be patrolling the streets; those little savages that he calls children were the best thing that happened to him), cousins, grandma, brother, mother. Everyone was cheerful. Everyone was overjoyed to see me. Their faces seemed flat, distorted even. I knew they existed; I recognized the colorful holiday-only jewelry, the poofy and slightly over the top hairstyles, some hand-me-downs and some new swag, but watching them through a screen made them less real. As if looking through a mist, and on the other side a portrait of a dream. I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of envy—I wanted to be in that portrait, painted right next to my grandma in her large, not-quite-ornate chair—queen of the humble kingdom. I didn’t want to keep them waiting, and I was constantly, nervously checking my wrist watch. The numbers deceiving time, always five minutes ahead. Frankly, watching them from a 13.3 inch frame, it was starting to hurt. I said my see-you-laters.<br><br>I took the oatmeal out of the microwave. When I sat down to eat at my empty table, my peripherals played games with my mind. I could still see the banquet. When would they start playing bachata, I wondered? My uniform already on, I put on my boots and headed out. A light mist, this one real, clung to the trees and cars. On the quiet drive to the base, I promised myself I wouldn’t miss another mid-fall dinner.<br><br>For more on my storytelling journey, please visit: <a href="https://raymonddelro.wordpress.com">Raymond's written word.</a>

      <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
      <p>
        One of my other passions is soccer. The "beautiful game" has been an important part of my life since I began to watch it in 2008, and play it in 2012. The culture of soccer is like nothing I have ever been a part of, a mutual love and respect of the game brings people from all walks of life together.<br><br>I currently volunteer with Play Soccer 2 Give, a non-profit organization focused on using soccer as a tool for social good.<br><br>Our motto is "Local Game, For Global Change".
